    <p>My Portfolio<br>
    Hi there, I'm @Craig Smith.<br><br>
    About Me<br>
    As of writing this, I am currently 19 years old with a mad facination of technology,that does not end with computers.
    When work is involved, I am very persistant. When somthing is set out in front of me, I always go the full mile to get the work done 
    at a good level of quality. I always make sure the work is sent in either early or on time.
    Growing up in the gray and misurable Rhondda, with no intrest in sports like all the other kids, My mind would naturally take an intrest in
    what was around me,that being technology. my specific facination, in perticular would be on how computers systems work and the development of the pc. while nowadays, its the possiblity that drives me forword in the subject.<br><br>
	Currently<br>
	Currently, I am on my first year of a four year Computer science course that includes a foundation year for an undergraduate degree. 
	Up until now, the course has opened me up to a mountain of new skills such as coding, website design, Cyber Security, Cryptography and database design. All of these subject
	fit well into my intrest on how these systems work.
    Skills
    As of now, my knowlege only span to a few coding languages such as c++, sql, HTML and Python. In cyber security I have learned verious encryption
	methodes such as The Caeser Cipher and vigenere cipher. I have also looked into cyber forensic and its process. Additionaly I have also learnt how to create a working
	database using SQL and Microsoft acces, and I use online tools such as draw IO to plan and structire the database. I Also know how to create a website using HTML while Also
	using tools like draw IO to help design them.<br>

    Recent Projects<br>
    As of recently, the recent projects that I have been doing are for my Programming module. This is so far for assignment 2.
    I have also been doing work for a database in Information Management, Assurance And Security. I have also been working on a website 
	for Professionalism, Employability, Enterprise, and Problem-Solving. Here's a list of work completed recently:<br>
    . Weight conversion table in C++: This is where the code has to convert imperial tones to pounds and Kilograms, using
	a loop. The code has to keep doing this in veriable of two until it reaches 20 imperial tons.<br>
    . Average speed in C++: In this code I had to input the time and distance between points x, y and z then the code puts that into an argument.
	Then that information had to be used to calculate the speed in KPH.<br>
    . Isosceles Triangle Class in C++: In this code, I had to create a program that would takes user inputs of the base and height of the
	triangle, then run that as a class, then take that information and use it to calculate the area and perimaters of the triangle.<br>
    . Student Performance Class in C++: This is simular to the Isosceles Triangle code but its about students score that needs to be calculated
	as a performance score, that then needs to be given a grade. There should be a verifaction of if the numbers go above 100.<br>
    . Grade Analysis in C++: In this code I need to create an array that take 10 student test score. It then should find all the score above 50
	and count how many there are.<br>
    . Identical Array in C++: In this code, I needed to write somthing that recognises that the valuse in two arrays are the same or not, and then
	output a message depending if they are identical or not.<br>
    . Number of Occurrences in C++: I needed to write code that would look through an array filled with names and count how many times a user-
	specified name occures in the list. If it does it should say how many times it appered. if not it should say it dosent apear on the list.<br>
    . Lottery Winners in C++: This was simuler to the identical arrays work but, it only has to be a number, not the whole array<br>
    . Test Score #1 in C++: In this code, I needed to create an array that holds any amount of elements defined by the user. Once every number
	is entered, it should sort them in assending order while also calculating the average score.<br>
    . Test Score #2 in C++: This builds off of Test Score #1, but This time it needs to pair both names and scores while still calculating the average score. <br>
    . Sports Team Database in SQL: For my final Information Management, Assurance And Security modual I needed to create a database for a sports
	club that holds the team, Players, physios, headcoach, club and match. I then needed to run querys to get answers for certain question outlined in the breif.
	GitHub Portfolio in HTML: As you can see from this portfolio, this to is the assignment for Professionalism, Employability, Enterprise, and Problem-Solving.<br>
	<br>
	There is the list of work that I can Show in the reposatory.<br><br>
    Hobbies<br>
    During The time I have between assisgnments, I fill it in by doing a few of my favourite activitys. The number one activity I like to do is play on my
	Guitar. From a young age, I have always been facinated by the music of yesteryear such has Black Sabboth, The Rolling Stones, Motorhead, The Beatles and even 
	Jimi Hendrix. So when I saved enough money, I ordered my very first guitar, a black stratacaster clone. This served me for a few years, but it wasnt great, so once
	I had a bit more money, I dicided to make my wallet cry a bit more, and bought a brand new Gibson les paul from the custome shop.<br><br>
	Another activity I do is tinkering around with my computers. Not to long ago I built a retro gaming pc using parts that were recommended on the back of the crysis gmaebox, and ever since I have been
	constantly messing around with that rig and my main gaming rig.<br><br>
	One final activity that I do is to either sit down with a good book or watch old movies or tv shows. I have been recently enjoying the Jeremy brett adaptation of 
	Sherlock Holmes Novel.
